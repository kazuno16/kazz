## Stable vs Dev vs FPS build

The stable build will usually crash less, and all features should work as intended. The dev build will have beta features but may crash at times. The FPS build is an alternative with less mods, however increased FPS

Stable build: https://resclient.vercel.app/

Development build: https://resclientdev.vercel.app/

FPS Build: https://resclientfps.vercel.app/

### Dev build status

**As of right now**, the development build works fine, and has the following new features:

* Development build was just merged into stable, no new features yet!

## FAQ

### Offline download?

Follow the youtube guide [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAZfXRdq-wQ). We are unable to provide an offline download of every single texture pack because it crashes most computers. Instead, you should follow the guide above in order to create an offline download of your desired texture packs.

### Eaglercraft 1.8?

Resent will be ported ASAP when the source code for eaglercraft 1.8 comes out.

### Which texture pack is best?

Good fps and good quality packs: Dino 16x, Venom 16x, Violet crystal pvp 32x

Good fps pack: Bare bones 16x

Decent fps and very good quality pack: Blue 128x

(I haven't tested most of the texture packs, these are just the ones that I've used or heard others use, I'm probably missing 20 texture packs in every category above.)
